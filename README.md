# meteor-panic

###### So what was it?
Endless survival game made in PyGame by Project IO (as in the Jupiter's moon) as a project for PSIT
###### Ok, so? What IS it?
A game. Using simple left and right movement, player must avoid collision with oncoming meteors falling from top of the screen. Player must use hand-eye coordination to (hopefully) survive as long as they can, and thus achieve the highest score.
